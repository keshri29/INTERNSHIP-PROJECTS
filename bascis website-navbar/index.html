  <h3>In the world of software programming, it helps to have someone on the team who is something of a jack of all trades. They can help with various stages of development and have the versatility and time management to assist all levels of the development team. When it comes to web development, that role belongs to the Full Stack Developer. This is not a Back End or Front End developer, but someone who handles both — a “Full Stack,” as it were.A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well. They are something of a swing, ready to assist wherever needed in the process.
    Some of the responsibilities of a Full Stack Developer include:
    Helping with the design and development of software
    Testing and debugging software to keep it optimized
    Writing clean code for the front and back end of the software
    Designing user interactions on the web application itself
    Creating servers and databases for the back end of the software
    Ensuring cross-platform compatibility and optimization
    Testing and maintaining the responsive design of applications
    Working with graphic designers to design new features
    Developing APIs and RESTful services
    Keeping up with technological advances to optimize their software
    Communicating effectiveness of emerging technologies to decision makers
